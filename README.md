# Quazicrystals


"A quasiperiodic crystal, or quasicrystal, is a structure that is ordered but not periodic. A quasicrystalline pattern can continuously fill all available space, but it lacks translational symmetry." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasicrystal)




This application creates images such as these:

A 7-fold symmetry quazi crystal generates 7 frames. Combine the with a free online gif making service and you can make animated gifs like this:

Here is a quazicrystal with 5-fold symmetry:

# Inspiration 

This application was created by translating from [this mathematica code](https://pastebin.com/brVmtp2B), which I found on this blog here:
[http://blog.matthen.com](http://blog.matthen.com/post/51566631087/quasicrystals-are-highly-structured-patterns-which)

This blog is truly awesome, check it out for many more cool animated images. The best part? Each animation includes the corresponding mathematica code that generates it!
