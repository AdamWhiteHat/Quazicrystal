# Quazicrystals


"A quasiperiodic crystal, or quasicrystal, is a structure that is ordered but not periodic. A quasicrystalline pattern can continuously fill all available space, but it lacks translational symmetry." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasicrystal)




This application generates images such as these:

But wait, theres more!

It doesnt generate just one of these images

A n-fold symmetry quazi crystal generates n frames. Combine them with a free online gif making service (or write your own routine in C#) and you can make animated gifs like this:

The above is an example of 7-fold rotational symmetry. Each frame is one of the 7 different rotations.



Here is a quazicrystal with 5-fold symmetry:

Technically, quazicrystals are rotations of order different from 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6. Any symmetries different from 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6 were once considered forbidden, that is, not able to be found in nature.




The key word here is WAS:

Neato!





# Inspiration

This application was created by translating from [this mathematica code](https://pastebin.com/brVmtp2B), which I found on this blog here:
[http://blog.matthen.com](http://blog.matthen.com/post/51566631087/quasicrystals-are-highly-structured-patterns-which)

This blog is truly awesome, check it out for many more cool animated images. The best part? Each animation includes the corresponding mathematica code that generates it!
